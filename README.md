# Clash-Of-Clans-Builder-Base-Script
This is a macro focused on gathering resources automatically for your builder base. Use this to get the 6th builder ASAP.

Google Play launcher needed for this. (Might work with other emulators, I didnt test it.)

Find the location of the Clash of Clans shortcut and copy the location by pressing Right click -> Copy as Path

Paste that location in the "clashOfClansFileLocation.txt" file.

Download Autohotkey here: https://autohotkey.com/download/1.1/AutoHotkey_1.1.37.02_setup.exe (NOTE: IT MUST BE THIS VERSION)

Don't use surrendermode if you want to push trophies. Use it if you want to farm Elixir as fast as possible.

Run the .ahk file

Press start and you're good to go!
