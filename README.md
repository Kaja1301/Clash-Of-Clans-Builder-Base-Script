# Clash-Of-Clans-Builder-Base-Script
This is a macro focused on gathering resources automatically for your builder base. Use this to get the 6th builder ASAP.

Google Play launcher needed for this.

Find the location of the Clash of Clans shortcut and copy the location by pressing Right click -> Copy as Path

Paste that location in the "clashOfClansFileLocation.txt" file.

Download Autohotkey here: https://autohotkey.com/download/1.1/AutoHotkey_1.1.37.02_setup.exe (NOTE: IT MUST BE THIS VERSION)

Edit config.txt to either enable surrendermode or disable it (set it true or false)

Don't use surrendermode if you want to push trophies. Use it if you want to farm Elixir as fast as possible.

Run the .ahk file

Make sure Clash of Clans is closed.

Press CTRL+K to start the script.
Press CTRL+E to stop the script at any Point.
