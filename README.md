Go to this website and download the launcher

From the launcher create an account and then download clash of Clans

When it asks if you want to create a shortcut, do it

Find the location of the shortcut and copy that

Paste that location in the "clashOfClansFileLocation.txt" file, it should be the only thing in there

Download Autohotkey here: https://autohotkey.com/download/1.1/AutoHotkey_1.1.37.02_setup.exe (NOTE: IT MUST BE THIS VERSION)

Edit config.txt to either enable surrendermode or disable it (set it true or false)

Don't use surrendermode if you want to push trophies. Use it if you want to farm Elixir as fast as possible.

Run the ahk script

Press Control K to start the script, it will run for a bit then stop so that when your storages are full it doesn't still run
Press Control E to stop the script at any Point
